YOGO ACTION RECOGNITION MODEL

Why I choose this?

"I chose to focus on yoga action recognition for several compelling reasons:

1. Technology Integration: 
    The integration of computer vision and action recognition technology showcases the power of technology in enhancing traditional practices, including health and fitness.

2. Health and Well-being: 
    Yoga is renowned for its holistic health benefits, including physical fitness, stress reduction, and mental clarity. I wanted to leverage technology to promote these well-being advantages.

3. Accessibility: 
    Yoga should be accessible to everyone, regardless of location or resources. By developing a yoga action recognition system, I aimed to make yoga practice accessible to a wider audience, especially those without easy access to yoga instructors.

4. Educational Tool: 
    I wanted to create an educational tool for yoga practitioners. By offering insights into each pose and guiding users toward proper form, the project enhances users' understanding of yoga principles.

5. Progress Tracking: 
    Tracking progress can be motivating and help individuals stay committed to their yoga practice. The system allows users to monitor their improvements over time.


Considering these benefits and the positive impact it can have on individuals' lives, I chose to develop a yoga action recognition system over other options, as it aligns with my passion for health, well-being, and technology."
